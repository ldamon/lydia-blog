üèÜ 2021 ScreenCraft Screenwriting Fellowship Quarterfinalist

üèÜ 2021 Launch Pad Pilot Competition Second Round

> "This is a well-written, darkly comedic pilot that reads like an acerbic lampooning of Oakland hipster culture and Millennial entitlement‚Ä¶will remind readers of INGRID GOES WEST. There are various highlights throughout which demonstrate the project‚Äôs potential‚Ä¶‚Äù

</br>


*Fun Bags* - original pilot

üèÜ 2021 Austin Film Festival Second Round

> ‚ÄúThis script has a well thought out, emotional foundation grounded in character and conflict...The first seven pages do a wonderful job of introducing us to the world and characters while deftly planting several seeds of conflict...This feels like a real group of friends.‚Äù


> ‚ÄîBrent Forrester class evaluation

</br>


*Big Mouth* ‚Äì spec episode

üèÜ 2021 Austin Film Festival Second Round

"Grizzly Peak"

üèÜ 2021 NYC Midnight Short Story Challenge Quarterfinalist
