<p>Hi, I'm Lydia! At one point I wanted to be a #Girlboss. Then I tried to hack it in the San Francisco standup scene. Now I'm a mom in Connecticut. All the while I have worked as a designer in tech, and it's been a wild ride. What's next? Let's find out!</p>

{% set postsCount = collections.posts | length %}
{% set latestPostsCount = postsCount | min(3) %}

{% set postslist = collections.posts | head(-3) %}
{% set postslistCounter = postsCount %}
{% include "postslist.njk" %}

{# List every content page in the project #}
{#
<ul>
	{%- for entry in collections.all %}
	<li><a href="{{ entry.url }}"><code>{{ entry.url }}</code></a></li>
	{%- endfor %}
</ul>
#}
