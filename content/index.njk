<p>Hi! I'm a comedian, writer and recovering wannabe-#Girlboss. I used to do standup in San Francisco. I work as a designer in the startup world and write stories about women and technology.</p>

<p>A reader on <i>The Black List</i> called my half-hour comedy <i>Artful</i> a "well-written, darkly comedic pilot."</p>

<p>I made the second round/quarterfinals in the <i>Austin Film Festival</i>, <i>Launch Pad Pilot Competition</i>, <i>NYC Midnight Short Story Challenge</i> and <i>Screencraft Screenwriting Fellowship</i>.</p>

<p>Now I live back on the east coast with a kid and probably a cold.</p>

<p>Email me if you'd like to read my work!</p>
