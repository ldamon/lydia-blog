If you see me this sumer, I am probably rocking one or both of these items.

Fishy bag by [Don Fisher]	:

Puppy clip:

Am I losing it, or am I the coolest girl ever? That's up to you maybe. But I am telling myself it's all part of Surrealism in fashion, a major trend of the moment.

For example, see [Schiaparelli and Surrealism](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/schiaparelli-and-surrealism-victoria-and-albert-museum/yQXRabXbe04rJw?hl=en). Examples below from the latest collections by Artistic Director [Daniel Roseberry](https://www.schiaparelli.com/en/21-place-vendome/daniel-roseberry/):

{% image "./schiap-lion.png", "Schiaparelli lion head" %}

Say what you will about the lion head, but from a historical and evolutionary perspective, the piece absolutely makes sense within the context of the brand. Boundary-pushing, and toeing the line between reality and artifice. (The hyperrealistic lion head is actually handmade in foam, wool and silk faux fur, then hand-painted.) It is at once the most real and most fake thing, which really speaks to our social media time, no?
Daniel R. seems like a super smart guy, plus judging by how [he made risotto with Ina Garten](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/t-magazine/ina-garten-risotto-recipe.html), he is a cool person.

Anyway, all this to say, I maintain that my chosen summer accessiories, while somewhat toddler-chic, are giving Fashion with a capital F, not crazy lady on the bus. Or maybe both and that's okay.
