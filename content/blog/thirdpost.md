### 2021
- Signup and first deploy flow

### 2022

Happy to talk about my experience IRL, but won't be sharing too many details here. Very grateful for my time at this exciting company, where I was able to expand and strengthen my experience with Growth practices and deepen my understanding of our developer customers. Onward!
