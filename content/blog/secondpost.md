After I got laid off, a colleague told me I “sounded chipper” over text. 
While I definitely was not feeling happy, I can see why I sounded less than devastated. For better or worse, I process things through comedy (hence my brief standup career in the Bay Area). 
What’s weird and a little cliché but I still want to say it is: I feel like I keep saying goodbye to versions of myself. Having my daughter. Leaving the Bay Area. Quitting various career switching dreams or side hustles. Moving to a smaller city. 
I now live across the country in a new (if familiar) place. As neutral as I could be on my tech career, this job at Netlify was the one thread still running through my pre-pregnant self into the current day. I would not say my job was my ultimate purpose, but I am proud of the work I did there! I founded and stayed on the Growth team for my almost-3 years at the company. I loved the people I worked with (and using parentheses in written communication). 
But I guess in the words of Natasha Bedingfield, the rest is still unwritten.
Stay tuned!
