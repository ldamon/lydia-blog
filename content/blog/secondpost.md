After I got laid off, a colleague told me I “sounded chipper” over text. 

While I definitely was not feeling happy in the least, I can see why I sounded less than devastated. For better or worse, I process things through comedy. (Hence my brief, embarrassing standup career in the Bay Area.)

A little cliché but I still want to say it: I feel like I keep saying goodbye to versions of myself. Having my daughter. Leaving the Bay Area. Quitting various career switching dreams or side hustles. Moving to a smaller city. 

I now live across the country in a new (if familiar) place. Things have a different (in most ways that matter, better) rhythm. As neutral as I could be on my tech career, this job was one of the last threads still running through my pre-pregnant self into the current day, and there was comfort in that. 

My time at Netlify may be over, but I'm proud of the work I accomplished. I founded and stayed on the Growth team for my almost-3 years at the company. I loved the people I worked with. (And using parentheses in written communication.) 

But I guess in the words of Natasha Bedingfield, the rest is still unwritten. Stay tuned!
