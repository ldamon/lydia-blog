I wanted to share that I redesigned my portfolio, and included three of my most recent projects.

{% image "./new-portfolio.png", "Screenshot of my new portfolio" %}

I decided not to get lost in a rabbit-hole of coding the thing from scratch, and instead tried out a tool with some high quality templates, [Readymag](https://www.readymag.com). (I found out about Readymag via a Reddit thread about creating portfolio sites.)

In the past, I have spent a lot of time (and had a lot of fun!) getting into the weeds of coding my own site, but this time, I wanted to focus on writing and presenting the case studies first and foremost without getting too distracted. 

I also needed something with password protection that was easy to set up because a lot of my work is sensitive or confidential.

I loved using Readymag and would definitely recommend it to any designer or creative professional looking to spin up a portfolio site!
