One fun thing I've started doing is playing tennis. I had played as a kid for fun, but never really took to it...until now. Knee injuries aside, it's been the perfect thing for me lately. Camaraderie, a routine, getting out there, and reconnecting with my athletic side.

Recently at practice the Tuesday after the Wimbledon Mens' Final, my coach pointed out what he took away from the match:

The difference between Alcaraz and Djokovic's final score was *two points*. 
Just two.
2.

So any time you're getting in your head about how you are losing, you're down, it's over, just remember, there's always the next point up for grabs. Just keep playing.
